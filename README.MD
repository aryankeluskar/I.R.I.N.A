# irina - An AI That Solves Minesweeper!

Built using Python. <b>I</b>nquisitive <b>R</b>iddler <b>I</b>nvestigating <b>N</b>avigational <b>A</b>rteries (in minesweeper), or irina for short (cause she is), is an Artifically Intelligent Model to solve Mineweeper by utilizing a probabilstic approach. It starts by randomly tapping 3 cells, then finds the probability of surrounding cells being a mine while training a Reinforcement Learning model in background to predict the next set of non-mine cells and click on them. This process repeats until there are no non-mine cells remaining. Most Exciting Thing? This algorithm is nearing world record timings and this is just the beginning.
